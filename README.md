# Coding-Fun
Just a place to keep all my programming projects in one place. 
My Chromebook doesn't have Dropbox locally, which makes doing stuff there difficult. 
My remote desktop in the lab also doesn't have Dropbox, so I can't even manage 
those remotely. So yea it's nice to have a repo to code anywhere.

## Languages and Projects
I want to add a variety of different projects, and write them in different languages.
This will give me practice with problem solving and exposure to syntaxes that may
have different programming philosophies and paradigms (c++ vs ruby vs python, for
example). 

#### Current Languages:
- python
- c++
- kotlin
- java

#### Languages I'd like to add:
- ruby
- c#
- go

### Projects
I am mostly starting with projects that require a range of skills. These skills will 
generally involve:
    - Basic object-oriented design 
    - Reading from files 
    - Writing to files
    - Importing different libraries
    - Reading from other files
    - Creating simple packages

#### ExpenseTracker
Up first we have the ExpenseTracker app, which is going to be a simple tool to 
manage all your monthly expenses. 
As mentioned above, I am going to write this in a bunch of different languages 
to get some practice becomming proficient in them. 
This project is a pretty simple way to do it. 
I could even extend it to work with SQL databases and maybe even an Android app. 
Kotlin and Java are included here for that reason. 

#### RentCalculator
This app will blah blah blah
