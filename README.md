Just a place to keep all my programming projects in one place. My Chromebook doesn't have Dropbox locally, which makes doing stuff there difficult. My remote desktop in the lab also doesn't have Dropbox, so I can't even manage those remotely. So yep.

Up first we have my ExpenseTracker app, which is going to be a simple tool to manage all your monthly expenses. I want to write it in a bunch of different languages to get some practice becomming proficient in them, so I came up with this simple way to do it. I could also extend it to work with SQL databases and maybe even an Android app (Kotlin and Java are included here). 

Current Languages:
- python
- c++
- kotlin
- java

Languages I want to add:
- ruby
- c#
- go
